SaltCountPractice

Description: A simple initial practice project designed to revisit the basics, and to help prepare for more "on-the-fly" coding in future projects.

Goal: Create a simple counter app using native frameworks (UIKit, CoreData, etc.) with a focus on MVC, dependency injection, and separation of concerns (will add other priorities that are also relevant in future). (Context: Practicing the basics, planning to start with a prototype following the previously-described, then rewrite using other patterns/libraries such as MVVM, Realm, Coordinator pattern, etc., before moving on to MVP and final product)
